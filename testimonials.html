        <h1>Testimonials</h1>

        <p class="firstTestimonial">Solis -<br/>We've just found the THE BEST lawn and yard care company I have worked with. Their prices are reasonable, their work is impeccable, and they are real gentlemen. You can't go wrong in hiring them.
        Gave C</p>

        <p>Solis-My husband and myself are overjoyed with job completion. I put a vague idea of what we thought was needed to be done. They took the ball and did job better than we could have ever of imagined. Everything is clutter free trees & shrubs & mulch that were put in look amazing. I would strongly use company again.
        Thanks  -Dionne D</p>

        <p>Hi Solis
          This group of gentlemen went above and beyond what we were hoping for in terms of the quality of the work, a fair price, and getting things done in a timely fashion. After getting several quotes and looking at several reviews on yelp and Angie's list, I noticed several positive reviews for Solis on my neighborhood's community web platform. I'm so grateful I called Solis. We needed a concrete slab poured for our new backyard shed, as well as several tree-sized arborvitae removed from the front. We couldn't be happier. Not only did Efrain and his team do a great job, his colleague Pablo came in to help and (I later learned) brought his over 25 years of landscaping experience to the table. What a beautiful and pristine job they did for us. It's hard to fine honest, hard working, professional folks who do what they say they'll do while also not overcharging - Solis delivered and then some. (Will be calling them next Spring for my big landscaping project!)

        <p>Solis <br /> Their work is far beyond our expectations! They came the next day we made our request. They are very professional and clean out all of the dirt afterwards! We would hire them again if we need contractors to perform other services. Very good job<br />
        Chong Z.</p>

        <p>Solis Solis did a great job landscaping my yard this spring. They are very responsive and the price was reasonable. They cleaned up a lot of overgrown, mulched, and hauled away all of the old overgrowth for my front and back yard and garden beds. Now we are ready for spring. I hired them to do landscaping this spring because they were doing a good job on snow removal over the winter. Their snow removal is very thorough including clearing all of the walkways and they have good pricing.<br/> 
          Adam S.</p>

        <p>Great. All winter long they would shovel (when cars were in the driveway) or plow (when we weren’t home).<br />

        Greg G.</p>

        <p> Mr. Solis and his team were professional and did a great job. When I called to inquire about the work he came out to discuss with me quickly. He worked with me to make sure the odd dimensions I wanted and the exact placement would be correct. He finished in the time he predicted and the quality of work was excellent. I would recommend this company to everyone. He mentioned he also does a lot of other kinds of work, and I am planning to have him come out and do a few other types of things in futurebr <br/>
        Patricia H.</p>

        <p>Both work scopes were completed to our full satisfaction. Ifran and his buddy showed up on time and got the work done pretty expeditiously. They left no mess behind. We as a first time customer were very happy with their professionalism and quality of the work<br />
        THANK YOU!<br />
        Inderpal D.</p>

        <p>Great job! He scheduled me easily by texting, and arrived as promised. I had a couple special requests, which were followed. Extra care was taken to trim walkway around a small fish pond and keep the grass trimmings from getting in the water. He even coiled up my forgotten hose. Thank you for noticing it!<br />
        Best,<br />
        Norma G.</p>

        <p>It was very pleasant, they are very friendly people, out to do their best and impress. They showed me samples and gave me many options but I left it up to them as they are the experts and it turned out great. They picked out a good strong stone they said would be durable and hold up over time. Suprisingly they did come unannounced the first day, but they explained that this was so they could get it done quickly and was just misscommunication. They were here for 4 days to get the job done. They were very helpful, they even removed an unrelated pile of dirt for me and they cleaned everything up really well, all at no ext<br />

        <p>Solis<br />
          Excellent. Solis is a great find. They are extremely responsive and their work is equal - or better - than that of massive landscape firms. Fully recommend.<br />
        
        Daniel G.</p>

        <p>Solis is great. Wonderful mowing and clean up. I’ve been using for 2 years now and will continue to use.<br />
        JJM</p>

        <p>Solis<br /> I first hired Solis Lawn Care last Fall following surgery, and they did such a good job I decided to have them back regularly this year. I have a commercial mower and could do it myself, but they do great work at a reasonable price. I particularly like that they use a commercial walk behind mower that won’t rut my yard like a ZTR mower. They are reliable and polite. I would recommend them to friends and family.
        <br /> Thanks,<br /> Gregg S.</p>

        <p> <br />Solis provided a very prompt and accurate estimate that included all materials and labor for installing our new fence. They scheduled the work quickly after I booked them and completed the work in a single afternoon. They did a great job, even making sure to add some extra partial fence pickets at the edges to make sure our small dog couldn't get out. We are very pleased with their work and look forward to hiring them again.
         <br />Thank you so much, <br /> Catherine S.</p>

        <p>They gave a good price for the work (compared to other estimates). They showed up on-time and finished the work in less time than they told me it would take.. They removed a tree that had fallen in a storm from my backyard and hauled it all away. Left my yard nice and clean.<br />
        Much appreciated!!<br />
         Sue F<br />
        
        <p> They arrived on time to give an estimate for tree trimming. I chose to move forward. They listened carefully to what I needed and moved on with it immediately. The finished appearance of all 5 trees exceeds my expectations. Clean up was complete and I even informed them that I may have additional future work for them. Very pleased with the results.

          <br />
        Take Care<br />
        Karen T. Canton, MI</p>

        <p>Solis.<br />They did a very good job with attention to detail. They were very hard workers. I was given a fair price. I was very pleased with the quality of work. I would not hesitate to hire them again or refer them to others!
          <br />
        Thank you!<br />
        Brent F,Ypsilanti,MI</p>

        <p> Mr Solis-<br />hey did good work. Assessed the tasks I gave them, developed a plan, then proceeded to perform the work in a safe, timely, and professional manner. I will contact them again when needed. <b/>
